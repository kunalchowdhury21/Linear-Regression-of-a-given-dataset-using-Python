This is a basic project in the domain of Machine Learning using linear regression(sub field of supervised machine learning). In this project we have first provided a dataset 
which contains the past data i.e. salary that is to be provided to an employee based on the years of expirience. We have applied a learning algorithm using Python in Jupyter Lab
that predicts the salary according to the years of expirience we put as an input. The learning algorithm uses the values from the past datas and predicts the salary for a given
input.

The stepwise analysis of my project-
1. First we have imported the dataset.
2. Applied Linear regression algorithm.
  a. Splitting the dataset into training set and test set.
  b. Fitting simple linear regression to the training set.
  c. Visualising the training set results.
  d. Visualising the test set results.
  e. Predicting the result(Salary) of ____(input) year(s) of expirience.
  f. Predicting the training set results.
  g. Predicting the test set rseults.
 3. Then we have finally predicted the errors along with accuracy.
